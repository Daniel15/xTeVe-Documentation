### General
#### DVR Guide is suddenly empty.
Plex and Emby will only display EPG data if it is current. If only old data is included, nothing is displayed in the Guide.  
To check an XMLTV file can be opened with a text editor

XMLTV example:
```
<programme channel="guide2go.90447.schedulesdirect.org" start="20190608004300 +0000" stop="20190608004500 +0000">

### xTeVe
#### Buffer on: Stream is not playing and there are error codes in the log, such as 403
These are [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_errors) status codes.  
For debugging, it is recommended to open the stream with VLC and open the message window.  
On the Mac:
> Shift + CMD + M

### Plex

##### Plex says:  
##### Device not found. Ensure your device is powered on and connected to your network.

If you're setting up xTeVe for the first time in Plex, that's normal, just restart Plex. If you often have the problem, it's usually a network problem.  
xTeVe is a UPnP server, which means it sends broadcast requests in the IPv4 network. If your server gets the IP address via DHCP, everything should work. If you have assigned the IP address yourself, you must also specify a broadcast address.

```
Network:   192.168.0.0/24
Broadcast: 192.168.0.255
```

#### Plex does not play the stream.
Plex DVR does not support any streaming format. 
To test the streams, the xteve.m3u can also be opened with the VLC Player.

#### Plex DVR can not be set up or channels are missing.
In Plex version 1.15 or higher, there is a bug in specifying the XMLTV link (HTTP)
##### Solution:
Use the file path of xteve.xml

The path can be found in the xTeVe log.
```
XEPG: Create XMLTV file (/home/USERNAME/.xteve/data/xteve.xml)
```
